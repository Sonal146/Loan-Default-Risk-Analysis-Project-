# Loan Default Risk Analysis Project  
**By Sonal Khobragade**

A deep exploratory dive into the financial behavior of borrowers to uncover *who defaults and why*. This project leverages rich customer-level data to answer *high-stakes business questions* with insights that could power real-world lending strategies.

##  Project Goal

To perform end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a lending dataset and uncover patterns that impact **loan defaults**, **interest rate strategies**, and **credit risk profiling**. The analysis aims to deliver business insights before building a machine learning pipeline.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized financial and demographic details of loan applicants, including:

-  `Annual_Income_INR`, `Loan_Amount_INR`
-  `Credit_Score`, `Interest_Rate_Percent`, `Debt_to_Income_Ratio`
-  `Age`, `Loan_Term_Months`, `Education_Level`, `Employment_Type`
- `Default_Status` (Target)

---

##  Key Questions Explored


1. How are `annual_income`, `loan_amount`, and `age` distributedâ€”and which transformations normalize them best?
2. How should `interest_rate` bands vary by borrower segments like prime vs subprime?
3. What does the correlation between `credit_score`, `DTI`, and `interest_rate` reveal?
4. How do default rates & loan sizes vary across age groups (21â€“30, 31â€“40, etc.)?
5. Are high-income borrowers actually getting better interest rates?
6. Do education & employment influence `credit_score`, `DTI`, and `default_rate`?
7. Which states/regions show highest loan uptake and how do their default rates compare?
8. How do dependents & existing loans correlate with `DTI` and `default_probabilities`?
9. Which loan purposes are riskiest and how do they vary across credit segments?
10. Do loan terms (12â€“60 months) affect interest rates and defaults?
11. Are there systematic differences across gender & marital status?


## Insights & Visuals

This project includes **beautifully customized visualizations** (Seaborn, Matplotlib) that answer the questions above. All plots are designed for storytelling with recruiters and stakeholders in mindâ€”clean, labeled, and high-impact.

##  Tools Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `Scikit-learn` *(for clustering only, no model training yet)*

---

## Next Steps (Out of Scope for Now)

Although we stopped at EDA for this phase, the dataset is ripe for:

- Building a **baseline ML model** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Feature engineering for credit risk prediction
- Building a dashboard (Tableau / PowerBI)
